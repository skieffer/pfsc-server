"""
This module is intended to be the home of all code that is responsible for
safely handling "free strings" in pfsc modules.

By a "free string" we mean any place in the syntax where the module author is
free to write any string whatsoever. These are the places in pfsc modules where
we have to think about HTML escaping and XSS safety.

When pfsc modules are parsed, they are first chunked, and annotations are handled
separately. Thus, the question has two parts: (1) Where are free strings in annotations,
and (2) Where are free strings in the pfsc module syntax minus annotations. We
find the following answers:

  (1) Annotations: The entire _contents_ of an annotation is a free string.
  (2) pfsc syntax minus annos:
      (A) Assignments. These occur at the top level, in deducs, and in nodes.
          The right-hand side of an assignment is arbitrary JSON, and thus may
          either _be_ a free string, or _contain_ one or more free strings.
      (B) defn's. The definiens and definiendum are both free strings.
  
Our security model is to ensure that every free string is HTML-escaped,
and to make that happen in one, central location, namely within this module.

One peculiarity of pfsc modules is that, in many settings, free strings may be
expected to contain VerTeX syntax. Since this is so widespread, we bundle VerTeX
translation (into ordinary TeX) along with our HTML-escaping. The two operations
happen together in our `vertex_and_escape` function -- henceforth "V&E".

In theory, and hopefully this will be maintained going forward, a security
audit should be able to begin by asking your IDE to find all usages of the V&E
function. At time of writing, the plan is that there should be exactly _two_ usages
of V&E -- one to handle annotation contents, and one to handle all free strings
occuring in pfsc syntax minus annos.

Free strings in pfsc syntax minus annos
---------------------------------------

Here the key invocation of the V&E function is in `PfscJsonTransformer.ve_string`.

To begin with, this means that _every_ string occuring in any JSON anywhere in
any pfsc module passes through V&E. In particular, this covers all strings
occurring in any assignments.

As for `defn`s, the pfsc module syntax defined in `modules.py` uses the `ve_string`
nonterminal from our custom JSON grammar. This means that the strings received here
go through `PfscJsonTransformer.ve_string` too.

   !!! NOTE: Going forward, any time a string is needed in the pfsc module
       syntax, you must use the `ve_string` nonterminal! 

Remark on universal escaping of strings in JSON: It is anticipated that, for
some applications, it will be necessary to _un_escape to make the string
usable again. This is by design. Consider the case of a new developer (or an old one who has
forgotten about security), adding a brand new widget type. Maybe this new widget
type takes a data field that is ruined by HTML-escapes. Under our design, the
developer is forced to become aware of security implications, because the escaped
string becomes unavoidable.

The alternative would be to leave it up to the developer to just magically "remember",
_without any prompting_, that widget data fields may need to be escaped. In that case,
our security model would be open-ended: it would have to be revisited every time you
added a new widget type. Essentially, every new extension would be a security hole
until patched. We prefer that every new extension be secure by design, and sometimes
you have to unescape to do what you need to do.


Annotation contents
-------------------

Here the key invocation of the V&E function is in the `render_anno_markdown` function.

    !!! NOTE: You should never turn annotation markdown into HTML except through
        the `render_anno_markdown` function.

When we process an annotation, every widget, which is of the form:

    <type:name>[label]{data}

is replaced with a stub:

    [label]{name}

The resulting text is what is passed through V&E in `render_anno_markdown`, before
being passed onward to markdown rendering.

This means that the only free strings in annos that don't go through this particular
V&E invocation are those occurring within widget data parts. But a widget data part
is just JSON syntax, and we parse this using our custom JSON parser. Therefore any
free strings occuring in widget data go through `PfscJsonTransformer.ve_string`.
It follows that all free parts of annotations are escaped.

# JSON Parsing
#
# We use a custom json parser for several reasons:
#   * Allow mutli-line strings as values, i.e. strings where a linebreak in the
#     input does not terminate the string but is simply accepted as a \n char.
#   * Allow strings to be delimited by " or '. Whichever is used, it can occur
#     within the string if escaped (as \" or \'). No other escapes are
#     processed.
#   * Allow strings to be delimited by """ or '''. In such strings, no escapes
#     are processed. WYSIWYG.
#   * Allow an extra comma at the end of an array or object.
#   * Allow both Python (True, False, None) and Javascript (true, false, null)
#     constants.
#   * Allow identifiers (as well as strings) as object keys, like in Javascript.
#   * Allow libpaths as primitives (along with strings, ints, floats, booleans,
#     and null). This requires a "scope" (any PfscObj instance) as a place to
#     resolve the libpath to an object. If no scope is provided, we simply
#     convert the libpath directly into a `Libpath` instance (a subclass of
#     `str` -- see below). Otherwise we resolve to an object. If the resolution
#     fails, we raise an exception. If the object is a PfscAssignment, it is
#     replaced by its RHS. Otherwise we again convert to a `Libpath` instance.

# We use a `json_` prefix to put the grammar definition within a namespace, so
# that it can be included as a sub-grammar elsewhere.

    This class does rendering for Proofscape-flavored Markdown.
    Its extensions over the base HTMLRenderer are as follows:
    
    (1) Correctly identify TeX math modes, giving these higher precedence
    than anything else in Markdown. This is necessary, for example, to avoid
    applying <i> tags in

        foo $a_1, a_2$ bar

    around the text between the two underscore characters in the math mode, as in

        foo $a<i>1, a</i>2$ bar
        
    (2) Identify widget stubs, and replace these with the HTML for the named
    widget. The latter is obtained from a lookup, passed to our constructor.
    
    (3) Mark links with class "external" and target "_blank".
    
    (4) Accept configuration parameters saying whether links are allowed,
    and whether images are allowed.
    
    (5) Blocks all HTML pass-through. This is intended only as a backup, since
    we expect that this renderer will only ever be applied to markdown that has
    already been HTML escaped.
     Notes:
      * [HTML pass-through is part of the CommonMark spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.28/#html-blocks)
      * [Some wish it weren't](https://talk.commonmark.org/t/remove-html-passthru-pass-through/1869)

    (6) Since we anticipate receiving only HTML-escaped text, this text will not
    include any angle brackets. Therefore it is impossible for the user to use
    `<URL>` style links. To make up for this lack, we add a special rule (outside
    the MD spec): if you use a link of the form `[](URL)`, i.e. with empty label,
    then we automatically set the URL as the label.
